# pMUTs_Layout_and_Analysis_Tool

This is a python tool for calculating equivalent parameters of individual pMUTs and generating layouts of pMUTs arrays.

Equivalent parameters can be calculated for stacks of 4 layers: an elastic layer, a bottom metal layer, a piezoelectric layer, and a top metal layer.
Properties that can be accounteed for are:

- The residual stress in each layer
- If ScAlN is used, all material properites are derived given the scandium concetration
- Surrounding medium to account for mass-loading

The capabilities of this project are shown in the jupyter notebook Tutorial.ipynb.
